            <span style="color: black;background-color: blanchedalmond;"><b>V</b>ictory seemed unlikely. Mount Saint Michael were two sets down and St. Leo’s certainly had the</span>
            upper hand in the third set, dominating 9 points to 2. Each time St. Leo’s scored, they pounded the
            ground in unison, further intimidating an already shaky Claremorris team. So how, in these
            circumstances, did they snatch victory from the jaws of almost certain defeat?

            <span style="color: black;background-color: blanchedalmond;"><b>T</b>he first set seemed to suggest two teams who were equally matched</span>. Michael’s fought point for
            point against a Leo’s team whose defence was almost impenetrable, yet Edel Nolan managed to hit
            home some impressive spikes. However, as the set drew to a close, they found themselves unable to
            finish the job and St Leo’s stormed into the second set with a 25-22 win in the first set under their
            belt.

            <span style="color: black;background-color: blanchedalmond;"><b>T</b>he third set began in similar fashion but sensing that they now had nothing to lose – except of</span>
            course the All-Ireland Title – the team lifted their game tremendously, aided by the now deafening
            cries of their desperate supporters, led by Lisa Brett and Chloe Hughes. Strategic use of time outs by
            coach Fionnghuala King saw the girls finally settle into the match. She no doubt reminded them of
            their team mantra – no matter how badly things seem to be going ‘don’t lose your marbles’.
            Stephanie Mellet had a great run of serves and made a stunning save at this crucial point in the set.
            Aisling Croghan made some unbelievable hits from the wings and Edel Nolan shone as the driving
            force behind Mount St Michael’s incredible comeback. They won the third set 25-16 and St Leo’s
            game began to fall apart.
